<!--In this task, you return to the problem posed in Task 1, with the aim of improving it. The three improvements we want you to make are:

    Refactor the code that generates the random number into a separate function called random(), which takes as parameters two generic bounds that the random number should be between, and returns the result.
    Update the chooseName() function so that it makes use of the random number function, takes the array to choose from as a parameter (making it more flexible), and returns the result.
    Print the returned result into the paragraph (para)'s textContent.

		Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example -->

const names = ['Chris', 'Li Kang', 'Anne', 'Francesca', 'Mustafa', 'Tina', 'Bert', 'Jada']
const para = document.createElement('p');
// Add your code here

function random(min,max){

	/* Generates a random number between 0 and 1 then multiplies it using (max - min + 1). 
	Then it adds the min value to the result of the previous multiplication (higher operator precedence).
	The +1 is to make the endrange inclusive.
	For example if you wouldn't include the +1 and you would use a range of 2 to 10, then only 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9 would be used.
	The function is designed to never exceed the max value because the result of Math.random() * (max - min + 1) is always less than (max - min + 1), and min is added to this result.
	For example, if max is 10 and min is 2, the range of possible values is 2 to 10. 
	The result of Math.random() * (max - min + 1) will always be a decimal value between 0 and 8, because (max - min + 1) 
	is equal to (10 - 2 + 1), which is equal to 8. *need to clarify this*

	When min is added to this result, the final value will always be between 2 and 10, inclusive. 
	It can never be higher than 10 or lower than 2.

	if (max >8 || max <0 || max >8 || max <0 || min > max || min === max) {
		alert('start number or end number cannot be higher than 8 or negative numbers. Min can also not exceed Max or be equal.');

		/*Here the console log uses the Math.floor() method to round the random number down to the nearest whole number.
		It takes the result returned by the randomNumber variable as an argument and then returns the nearest whole number.
