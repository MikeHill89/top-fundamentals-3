<!--In this task, you return to the problem posed in Task 1, with the aim of improving it. The three improvements we want you to make are:

    Refactor the code that generates the random number into a separate function called random(), which takes as parameters two generic bounds that the random number should be between, and returns the result.
    Update the chooseName() function so that it makes use of the random number function, takes the array to choose from as a parameter (making it more flexible), and returns the result.
    Print the returned result into the paragraph (para)'s textContent.

		Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example -->

function random(startrange,endrange){

	/* Generates a random number between 0 and 1 then multiplies it by taking the startrange - endrange + 1 and then adds the endrange.
	The +1 is to make the endrange inclusive.
	For example if you wouldn't include the +1 and you would use a range of 1 to 5, then only 1,2,3,4 would be used.
	
	The  + endrange at the end adds the value of endrange to the random number making sure it is shifted up to the numbers in between 
	the start and endrange. Without the + endrange part of the expression the variable could contain a value of 0 to 1 exclusive. 
	However by adding the endrange, the number is then shifted up.
