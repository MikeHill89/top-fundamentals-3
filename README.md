Exercise files from Top Fundamentals 3
These are files I created by following through various exercises throughout The Odin Project Fundamentals part 3.
They mainly cover how to define and invoke different kind of functions.
How return values works, and what function scope is.

The majority of exercises come from mozille dev network or javascript.info.
I created this repository for them as a sort of save button.
